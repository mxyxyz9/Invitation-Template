##  Invite Template🎉

Welcome to the **Sayonara** repo, your one-stop-shop for the *ultimate* senior send-off invite! We’ve turned farewell feels into a slick, responsive HTML/CSS page that’ll have everyone screaming “I’m there!” in no time. 🚀

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- **`index.html`** – The full invitation markup  
- **Inline CSS** – Zero dependencies, all the styles you need in one place  
- **Responsive Design** – Looks fire on desktop, mobile, and whatever weird tablet your friend still uses

## 🌈 Why You’ll Love It

- **Customizable AF** – Swap colors, fonts, and text to match your school vibe 🎨  
- **No Build Tools** – Just clone, edit, and launch. No node_modules drama.  
- **Hover Animations** – Subtle pops and scales for that extra *oomph* ✨  
- **Gen Z‑Approved** – Bold headlines, friendly copy, and a “Count Me In” button that slaps

   ```
3. **Open it**  
   - Double‑click `index.html` or drop it in your fave browser  
4. **Edit the fun stuff**  
   - Replace **`<EVENT_DATE>`**, **`<LAUNCH_DATE>`**, and all `<PLACEHOLDER_TEXT>` in the HTML  
   - Tweak colors in the `<style>` block to match your school colors

## ✨ Pro Tips

- **Photos & Logos**: Add your school crest or epic background by inserting an `<img>` tag where you see fit.  
- **Extra Sections**: Want to list sponsors, food menus, or playlists? Duplicate the `.message` paragraphs and style away.  
- **Analytics**: Slide in your Google Analytics or pixel snippet right before the closing `</body>` tag.
